# Game of Life


## Overview

The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. This project is an implementation of the Game of Life using Raylib.

## Features

- Customizable grid size
- Adjustable initial configuration
- Step-by-step simulation
- Continuous simulation with adjustable speed

## Installation

To get started with the Game of Life project, simply run the following command:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/0300dbdd1b/GameOfLife &&
cd GameOfLife &&
make
```

## Usage

To run the Game of Life simulation, use the following command:

```sh
./game_of_life
```

### Controls

| Key       | Action                          |
|-----------|---------------------------------|
| **[**     | Decrease the grid size          |
| **]**     | Increase the grid size          |
| **Space** | Pause or resume the simulation  |
| **X**     | Recenter the grid               |
| **R**     | Randomize the grid              |
| **C**     | Clear the grid                  |
| **F**     | Increase simulation speed       |
| **S**     | Decrease simulation speed       |
